Everpix Intelligence
--------------------

Everpix was created in 2011 with the goal of solving the Photo Mess, an increasingly real pain point in people's life photo collections, through ambitious engineering and user experience. At the end of 2013, Everpix wasn't able to raise sufficient funding to continue operating and had to shut down. At this time, the Everpix platform had 50,000 users and 400 millions photos while generating subscription sales of $40,000 / month during the last 3 months (enough money to cover variable costs, but not the fixed costs of the business).

Building a startup is about taking on a challenge and working countless hours on solving it. Most startups do not make it but rarely do they reveal the story behind, leaving their users often frustrated. Because we wanted the Everpix community to understand some of the dynamics in the startup world and why we had to come to such a painful ending, we worked closely with a reporter from The Verge who chronicled our last couple weeks. The [resulting article](http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5039216/everpix-life-and-death-inside-the-worlds-best-photo-startup) generated extensive coverage and also some healthy discussions around some of our high-level metrics and financials. There was a lot more internal data we wanted to share but it wasn't the right medium at the time.

With the Everpix shutdown behind us, we had the chance to put together a significant data set covering our business from fundraising to metrics. We hope this rare and uncensored inside look at the internals of a startup will benefit the startup community.

Here are some example of common startup questions this data helps answering:
- What are investment terms for consecutive convertible notes and an equity seed round? What does the end cap table look like? (see [here](Financials.md))
- How does a Silicon Valley startup spend its raised money during 2 years? (see [here](Financials.md))
- What does a VC pitch deck look like? (see [here](Presentation Slides/Everpix VC Pitch Deck.pdf))
- What reasons do VCs give when they pass? (see [here](Anonymized VC Feedback.md))
- What are the open rate and click rate of transactional and marketing emails? (see [here](Internal Metrics/Sendgrid %28Emails to Everpix Users%29.csv))
- What web traffic does coverage by various outlets generate? (see [here](Public Feedback/Press Coverage.csv) and [here](External Metrics/Daily Website Traffic.csv))
