Introduction

TBD

Here are some example of common startup questions this data helps answering:
- What are investment terms for consecutive convertible notes and an equity seed round? What does the end cap table look like? (see [here](Financials.md))
- How does a Silicon Valley startup spend its raised money during 2 years? (see [here](Financials.md))
- What does a VC pitch deck look like? (see [here](Presentation Slides/Everpix VC Pitch Deck.pdf))
- What reasons do VCs give when they pass? (see [here](Anonymized VC Feedback.md))
- What are the open rate and click rate of transactional and marketing emails? (see [here](Internal Metrics/Sendgrid %28Emails to Everpix Users%29.csv))
- What web traffic does coverage by various outlets generate? (see [here](Public Feedback/Press Coverage.csv) and [here](External Metrics/Daily Website Traffic.csv))
